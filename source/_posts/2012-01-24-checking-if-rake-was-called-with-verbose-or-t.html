title: Checking If Rake Was Called With Verbose Or Trace
---
<p>Recently we needed to check whether a rake task was called with the --verbose or --trace flags.</p>
<p>For verbose you can do the following inside your rake task:</p>
<p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1670723.js?file=verbose.rb"></script>
</p>
<p>Pretty simple, right? Be careful though, the default value for verbose is the symbol :default so using it in a predicate like `if verbose` will allow it to pass through. You will need to explicitly compare it to true.</p>
<p>Checking if your rake task was called with --trace is a bit more, well, verbose. Here is how you would do that:</p>
<p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1670723.js?file=trace.rb"></script>
</p>
