title: Quick iOS App for Comparing All Fonts
---
<p>I threw together a quick iOS app for viewing all of the fonts on the device. There are some more featureful apps for looking at each of the device's fonts, such as <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fonts/id285217489?mt=8" title="Fonts">Fonts</a>, but we didn't see any that let us view a custom string in every font, all in one table. But it only took 20 minutes or so to create exactly what we needed. I've shared the source on GitHub at&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/raylillywhite/FontTest">https://github.com/raylillywhite/FontTest</a>, in case it sounds useful to anyone. As you can see below, it was quick and dirty ;)[[posterous-content:pgJnidDynwqklGcJvdoH]]</p>
