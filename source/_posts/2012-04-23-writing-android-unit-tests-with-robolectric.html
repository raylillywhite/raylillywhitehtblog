<p>Until recently, I&rsquo;ve been unable to configure a <a href="http://pivotal.github.com/robolectric/" title="Robolectric" target="_self">Robolectric</a> project that can easily be shared across a team and integrated with <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/" title="Jenkins CI" target="_self">Jenkins CI</a> without the use of Maven. I mentioned this in a previous post, and have asked for assistance on Pivotal&rsquo;s <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/robolectric?pli=1" title="Robolectric Google Group" target="_self">Robolectric Google Group</a> a handful of times.
