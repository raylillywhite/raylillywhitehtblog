title: Rails and Mobile and Hotels Oh My!

<p class="p1">Welcome to the HotelTonight engineering blog. We've spent the last year creating an <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hotel-tonight-last-minute/id407690035?mt=8" title="HotelTonight iPhone app" target="_blank">awesome mobile app</a> and an extensive back end to power our apps and support our hotel partners. Along the way we've employed and built some very interesting technology. The first version of the iPhone app, and corresponding server side components, were developed in about 2.5 months by two developers, with help from a designer, and business folks. During this time we built the first mobile-only online travel agency, and believe the most major innovation in travel since opaque deals. &nbsp;This has&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hoteltonight.com/press" title="HotelTonight's great press" target="_blank">delighted</a> both end users and hotels. We didn't stop there.</p>
<p class="p2">HotelTonight has continued to innovate. We just released the <a href="http://www.tnooz.com/2011/11/15/mobile/revenue-managers-go-mobile-with-hoteltonight-extranet" target="_blank">world's first mobile extranet for hotels</a>. In addition, we recently rewrote our entire iPhone app to get from 4.5 to 5 stars (watch for a future blog entry). We could be biased, but we believe it is the best travel app in the App Store. We have several cool projects in the works right now that we'll share here as they get released. We use a lot of open source, are working on releasing some of our own, and contributing back changes (some of which are available now in <a href="https://github.com/hoteltonight" title="HotelTonight on GitHub" target="_blank">our GitHub</a> forks). &nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">In the near future on this blog, some of the topics we're planning to cover include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our Git workflow and scripts</li>
<li>How we leverage "virtual credit cards"</li>
<li>Cool code and techniques used in our iOS app</li>
<li>Some fun CSS tricks</li>
<li>CoffeeScript, Haml, and templating</li>
<li>Interesting details on the code that actually books a room</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">Stay tuned for our first real blog entry. And, please tell us what you'd like to know about HotelTonight engineering and technology.</p>
