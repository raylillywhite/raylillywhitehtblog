<div class="entry-content"><p>This post describes how we&#8217;ve come to develop some <a href="http://github.com/hoteltonight/git-scripts">git scripts and shortcuts</a> to help manage our development process at Hotel Tonight. All the aliases/functions I use in the examples below are documented there.</p>
<h2>Some History</h2>
<p>When we first started working on Hotel Tonight, we adopted the <a href="http://reinh.com/blog/2008/08/27/hack-and-and-ship.html">hack &amp;&amp; ship</a> workflow to facilitate performing all work on feature-specific branches. As long as we had fewer developers than software projects, that worked great, because it was very unusual for more than one person to work on a feature before it was ready to ship to master.</p>
<p>Somewhat similar to <a href="http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html">GitHub&#8217;s workflow</a>, we don&#8217;t have formal releases, and like to keep master always in a deployable state. So that means that when we want to collaborate on a new feature, we do it in a remote branch. And that&#8217;s where things become tricky.</p>
<h2>The dark side of rebasing</h2>
<p>The original hack script pulls in other people&#8217;s changes <em>from master</em>, by rebasing your branch onto master each time. This presents two problems if you&#8217;re working on a shared remote branch with others &#8211; first, it&#8217;s not what you&#8217;re most interested in. That is, while you&#8217;d like to keep up with changes on master, what you <em>really</em> want is to keep up with other people&#8217;s changes on your branch.</p>
<p>Second, and this is what really bit us, if you rebase commits you&#8217;ve already shared with others onto master, you&#8217;re in effect rewriting history, and chaos ensues. Witness:</p>
<p>I create a new branch and start working on some feature&#8211;</p>

<p>Now my coworker checks it out, enters some of his ideas&#8211;</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="CodeRay">

<p>Meanwhile, say there have been some changes on master, and I want to pull those in, and then do some more work on the ball, then share that. Our old hack would do a rebase onto master..</p>

<p>And here&#8217;s where things break down. My history doesn&#8217;t match up with the remote history anymore (3fc53df is from master):</p>

<p>Git suggests merging the remote changes, but that isn&#8217;t pretty&#8211;</p>

<p>Alternately, we could force push, but then look what happens when Patrick tries to update:</p>

</div>

</blockquote>
<p>What a mess! So, clearly, this doesn&#8217;t work. And, if you start squashing stuff, which we like to do sometimes, so that we don&#8217;t have to spam github with all our intermediate work, the history-rewriting merge-conflict-creating situation becomes even uglier.</p>
<h2>A kinder, gentler way to share</h2>
<p>In order to control this potential for chaos, we needed a better strategy for how branches are shared. This is the procedure I came up with:</p>
<ol>
<li>When you &#8216;hack&#8217; on a shared branch, you rebase your local changes <em>onto the remote branch</em>, not onto master. New commits from master are <em>not</em> pulled in during hack.</li>
<li>When you &#8216;share&#8217; your changes to an existing shared branch, first do an interactive rebase onto the remote, so you can squash, then <em>merge</em> in anything new from master, right before pushing. This is the only safe time to merge in from master, because you don&#8217;t want to squash changes from master in amongst your local changes.</li>
<li>When you &#8216;ship&#8217; to master, do an interactive rebase onto master, to do a big squash of all the branch work &#8211; and at that point, the remote branch is considered deprecated and should be removed, since its history no longer matches.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here&#8217;s what that process looks like, starting over with a new disco ball branch:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>[chris example (master)]$ gcb disco_ball
 Switched to a new branch 'disco_ball'

[chris example (disco_ball)]$ vi ball.rb

</div>

</blockquote>
<p>OK, so &#8216;share&#8217; at this stage basically just created a new remote branch for us. Now Patrick wants to check that out; we&#8217;ll give him a shortcut to see what&#8217;s available and &#8216;borrow&#8217; it:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>[patrick example (master)]$ borrow

 Already up-to-date.
   disco_ball
   master

[patrick example (master)]$ borrow disco_ball
 Branch disco_ball set up to track remote branch disco_ball from origin.
 Switched to a new branch 'disco_ball'</pre></div>
</div>

</blockquote>
<p>Now let&#8217;s say Patrick makes a few changes, and wants to share them with me.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>[patrick example (disco_ball)]$ vi ball.rb

[patrick example (disco_ball *)]$ gac
 [disco_ball 840074c] Another thought on the disco ball

[patrick example (disco_ball *)]$ gac
 [disco_ball bb06e68] No, wait, that was stupid, this instead.
  1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 1 deletions(-)

[patrick example (disco_ball)]$ share -notest</pre></div>
</div>

</blockquote>
<p>At that point he&#8217;ll have a chance to squash:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>pick 021e621 Another thought on the disco ball
pick f3b8218 No, wait, that was stupid, this instead.

# Rebase 77f1fa3..f3b8218 onto 77f1fa3
...</pre></div>
</div>

</blockquote>
<p>The initial commit on the branch, which already exists in the remote, isn&#8217;t listed here; that wouldn&#8217;t be safe to squash.</p>
<p>When the rebase is done the share will merge in the latest from master, and push to the remote. Note the &#8216;-notest&#8217; parameter; normally &#8216;share&#8217; would notice that there was new stuff from master merged in, and run tests before pushing to make sure they hadn&#8217;t broken anything &#8211; since there aren&#8217;t any tests set up for this example repo, we&#8217;ll just skip that. In practice, you&#8217;ll likely need to modify the &#8216;runtests&#8217; script to actually run your project&#8217;s tests correctly.</p>
<p>When I next &#8216;hack&#8217;, I&#8217;ll get both Patrick&#8217;s changes, and the latest from master that was merged in when he shared:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>[chris example (disco_ball)]$ hack

  * branch            disco_ball -&gt; FETCH_HEAD

 2 files changed, 2 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
  create mode 100644 ceiling.rb

</div>

</blockquote>
<h2>Ship It</h2>
<p>So now if I&#8217;m ready to release the feature to master, I can just &#8216;ship&#8217; normally. I&#8217;ll get a chance to squash everything on the branch:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>pick 77f1fa3 Some initial thoughts on implementing the ball
pick dd47d48 Another thought on the disco ball

# Rebase a6ed99a..0bf7d4c onto a6ed99a
...</pre></div>
</div>

</blockquote>
<p>And then it&#8217;s merged into master, and I&#8217;m warned to get rid of the remote. The &#8216;gbdone&#8217; script will remove the shipped local and remote branches.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>[chris example (disco_ball)]$ ship

 IMPORTANT: Please remember that your local branch has a conflicting

 keep working on the remote; it needs to be blown away via either outright
 removal or forced push.

<h2>A slightly more cautious way to ship</h2>
<p>Alternately, you may want to do a code review and/or some extra testing, after rebasing onto master and squashing your changes, but before shipping. So we added a convenience method to &#8216;pack&#8217; your code into another branch before release. Then you can &#8216;share&#8217; that for code review, or just play with it locally, and ship it normally when you&#8217;re done.</p>

</blockquote>
<h2>In summary</h2>
<p>I guess that all sounds a bit complicated. But once you get into the routine, it&#8217;s pretty frictionless. When you&#8217;re not sharing a branch, hack and ship still work the same as before. When you are, all you need to do most of the time is &#8216;share&#8217; periodically to keep everybody in sync, or &#8216;hack&#8217; occasionally if you want to pull in a coworker&#8217;s changes before yours are ready to share.</p>
<p>There are still a few edge cases, mostly around what happens when there are legit conflicts &#8211; some of those the scripts will detect and help you out with, others we might still need to work on. Again, all of it&#8217;s available here:</p>
